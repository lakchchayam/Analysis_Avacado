# Analysis_Avacado
The Avocado dataset came directly from retailersâ€™ cash registers based on the actual retail sales of Hass avocados. The average price reflects the cost per unit even when there are multiple units are sold in the bag. During dataset exploration there was no missing values noted. The total volume and total bags columns were dropped because total volume represents a sum of Hass Avocado bags for various PLU codes plus total bags; total  bags  column  was  dropped  as  well  because  it  represents  a  sum  of  various  avocado  bag  sizes.  The  date  column was dropped since it has too many levels, it is recorded as day, month and year, and region column was dropped as well because there are too many levels for the purpose of our analysis, fifty five regions were in the dataset.
